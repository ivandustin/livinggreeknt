## ORIGINAL GREEK TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT IDENTIFIED?

There are thousands of source manuscripts for the New Testament, but there are thousands of minor variations in those ancient documents. The variations are there because, prior to the invention of the printing press about 600 years ago, every version had to be hand-copied, and in the copying came errors. No original writings have been preserved. We have to start with what are copies of copies of copies.

It is the work of textual critics to collect ancient manuscripts and to compare different versions and to decide on what they believe might be the divinely inspired text. How can they be sure? Who is to say that this is more accurate than that?

However, we looked beneath the plain text. Every letter of the Greek alphabet has a [numeric value](pdf/greek-alphabet-cursive.pdf). This means that the Greek text of the New Testament may also be seen as a mathematical document. **We believe that this study of the underlying design provides verification of the original text.**

**We are grateful to Dr Alan Bunning of the Center for New Testament Restoration for the work done to identify the original Greek text of the New Testament.** There is no better place for anyone to start these studies than with an examination of the CNTR website. We recommend that serious students might click on the first link (CNTR Project Description) in the first paragraph of the Home page of [the CNTR website](https://greekcntr.org/index.htm). This will open a PDF file. Reading from pages 5 to 26 of this document will give you more insight than that held by many scholars.

Also helpful will be to take a look at this [timeline](TIMELINE.md) of how our Bible came to be.

## Explanation

The Greek text of the New Testament is in column 4. An explanation of the Greek text continues below.

### OTHER INFORMATION

The number in column one is from the CNTR text. The first two figures identify the book of the New Testament. The next two figures identify the chapter, and the last two figures identify the verse.

Column 3 is the word order in the Greek of that book of the New Testament. Word number 00001 is ΒΙΒΛΟΣ (book). Word order is worth examining. For example, the first occurrence of the word for Jesus, in the form ΙΗΣΟΥΣ (numeric value 888), is found at position 00243 in Matthew chapter 1. This is almost certainly not by chance. 243 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3. According to 1 John 5:7-8 three testify, and the testimony is of Jesus.


Column 5 is the number of Greek letters in each word, together with the total number of letters in the verse.

Column 6 is the number of Greek words in the verse.

Column 7 is the total numeric value of each word (using this table of [Greek letter values](pdf/greek-alphabet-numerics.pdf)), together with the total numeric value of the verse.

## The Greek text

### SOURCE

Our starting point is the text prepared by the Center for New Testament Restoration (CNTR).

Dr Alan Bunning of CNTR undertakes scientific analysis of more ancient manuscripts than ever before examined in the history of textual criticism. Most modern New Testament Greek texts are based on manuscripts that date from the Middle Ages, copies that were made more than a thousand years after the death of those who had been with Jesus. Dr Bunning has assembled 193 manuscripts all dated prior to 400AD, and he has made them freely available in a digital database.

Dr Bunning points out "that there are over 35 places where every early manuscript is in agreement with how a word is spelled, but every modern critical text has changed that spelling to a different form."

An example is the 6th word in the book of Matthew, ΔΑΥΕΙΔ (David). The Textus Receptus, the Westcott-Hort text, and the Nestle-Aland text (used by the United Bible Societies), all render this spelling as ΔΑΥΙΔ. But the earliest manuscripts all render this ΔΑΥΕΙΔ.

The epsilon (Ε) in ΔΑΥΕΙΔ makes a difference in the numerics of the word, the verse and, together with other variants, to the underlying mathematics of the New Testament.

The correction in the spelling of ΔΑΥΕΙΔ, and in four other names in Matthew 1 (ΟΖΕΙΑΝ, ΕΛΙΑΚΕΙΜ, ΑΧΕΙΜ, and ΜΑΘΘΑΝ), makes no difference to the accuracy of translations into English, nor to theology, but it obviously affects the numerics.

### FORMAT

Our Greek text is presented in all uppercase letters. The original Greek was written in all uppercase letters.

A review of the CNTR website will show that certain letters had a different form in New Testament times (eg, sigma was in this form С rather than Σ), but we are using modern Greek uppercase letters because they are familiar to most students. The numeric value of letters are not affected.

In the original New Testament writing there was no punctuation in the text and no space left between words.

### CURSIVE SCRIPT

Greek writing changed around the 8th Century AD. Cursive script came into use. This is the lettering style that is in use in modern New Testament Greek readers. However, it was not the writing style of Bible times. To quote Dr Bunning "...students today are learning to read Medieval Greek that is almost unrecognizable from its earlier form."

Diacritic marks were also added to the cursive script of the New Testament text. The diacritics were to help with pronunciation.

**However, two marks were put in place to indicate that certain letters in the original writing were dropped from the text.** One of these is the [iota subscript](IOTA.md). The other is used to indicate the [apocopic](APOCOPIC.md) form of a word.

In all cases, we have restored the dropped letters. This does not affect translation into English, or theology, but it does affect the numerics.

## CNTR

In our effort to identify the original Greek text of the New Testament through analysis of the underlying numeric structure, there is currently no better place to start than with the work that is being done in textual criticism by the Center for New Testament Restoration (CNTR).

We are not affiliated with CNTR. To the best of our knowledge, our work is not an approach that has been undertaken by CNTR.

However, we have to have a starting point, and the CNTR text has been made freely available on [their website](https://greekcntr.org/).

### Center for New Testament Restoration (CNTR)

CNTR conducts advanced work in textual criticism, using computer analysis and comparing more source manuscripts than ever previously examined. CNTR is the work of Alan Bunning, a lecturer at Purdue University in Indiana, and a graduate in New Testament Greek from the Kensington Theological Academy.

## OT Explanation

The Hebrew text is in column 4. It is taken from the Westminster Leningrad Codex.

The number in the first column identifies the book of the Old Testament in the first two figures. The next two figures identify the chapter, and the last figures identify the verse.

Column 3 is the word order in the Hebrew of that book of the Old Testament.

Column 5 is the number of Hebrew letters in each word, together with the total number of letters in the verse.

Column 6 is the number of Hebrew words in the verse.

Column 7 is the total numeric value of each word (using this table of [Hebrew letter values](pdf/hebrew-alphabet-numerics.pdf)), together with the total numeric value of the verse.
